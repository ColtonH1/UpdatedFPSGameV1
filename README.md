This is an updated game from a previous class. Professor Kumar gave us permission at the beginning of the semester to build off of a previous game.

We list in detail the differences of the previous game and the new game in our report and our slides.

To play, there is a build titled: "CS4361_Build"
Click on this and choose "Project 2 FPS.exe" (this is titled from my previous class)
The instructions on how to play is detailed out within the game itself

All scripts can be found under the "Scripts" folder
